## Hacker-Cache (alias buffer)
I live in London, and while commuting on the tube I don't have access to the internet which can be annoying.
Every morning I open up my favourite news source to read about tech and the likes, only to go through a single article before I am swept into internet darkness.

So this repo is a service (written in Java 8 Spring Boot sue me) which pulls the links for the articles on the top of hackernews and puts them into iframes which are then concatenated onto a single web-page which can be loaded in one go (albeit slowly).

It works reasonably well. This should probably be an app. But this was made in 3 hours, so screw that.

I hope you find this useful.
